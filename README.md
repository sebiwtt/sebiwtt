### Hi there 👋

My name is Sebi. I am a Computer Science (ML & AI) Student 🎓 a former Software Engineer 👨🏼‍💻 at Deutsche Telekom, and right now a Data Scientist at Merck KGaA in Darmstadt, Germany. 

I am especially interested in web development 🌐 and machine learning 🤖, and I am currently working on MLOps-related topics to combine these two topics.
